# From DS to MLOPs

From Data Science to MLOPs workshop

# Dataset
## Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

For this workshop we are going to work with the following dataset:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

### Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

# Virtual Environment

Firt we need to create a virtual environment for the project, to keep track of every dependency, it is also useful to use and explicit version of Python

Install the package for creating a virtual environment:
`$ pip install virtualenv`

Create a new virtual environment
`$ virtualenv venv`

Activate virtual environment
`$ source venv/bin/activate`

# Python packages

Now with the virtual environment we can install the dependencies written in requirements.txt

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Train

After we have install all the dependencies we can now run the script in code/train.py, this script takes the input data and outputs a trained model and a pipeline for our web service.

`$ python code/train.py`

# Web application

Finally we can test our web application by running:

`$ flask run -p 5000`

# Docker

Now that we have our web application running, we can use the Dockerfile to create an image for running our web application inside a container

`$ docker build . -t from_ds_to_mlops`

And now we can test our application using Docker

`$ docker run -p 8000:8000 from_ds_to_mlops`

URL: 
`localhost:8000/info`
`localhost:8000/health`

# Test!

Test by using the calls in tests/example_calls.txt from the terminal

# 1. Github Actions Intro

![](image/GithubActions.png)

https://docs.github.com/en/actions

- A free tool.

- Serverless.

- Easy to setup and manage.


# 2. Basics

## Workflow
In one Github Repository, you can have multiple workflows.
```
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       ├── deliver.yaml
│       └── run_test_on_PR.yaml
```
## Events
- Push.

- Pull_request.

- Schedule.

- Issue.

- External Event

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
      - main
```

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
  # minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
    - cron: '0 5 */1 * *'
```

## Jobs
In one workflow you can have multiple jobs.

Jobs can be in parallel or in sequence.

key word: `needs`
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: ...
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps: ...
```

## Steps
In one job you can have multiple steps
```yaml
jobs:
  run_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      - name: run bash commands
        run: |
          pwd
          ls -al
        shell: bash
```
## Actions
https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions

Actions are the building blocks that power your workflow. They are like functions in Python. You can either write your own action and reference it or simply just use an action from a public repository.

To use an action, use the key word `uses`
To provide arguments to an action: use the key word `with`
```yaml
jobs:
  run_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2 #https://github.com/actions/checkout
      - name: Set up Python 3.8 
        uses: actions/setup-python@v1 # https://github.com/actions/setup-python
        with:
          python-version: 3.8
```

By default Github Action doesn't clone your repo to the Github hosted server. Therefore we have to clone it by ourselves. The easiest way to do that is using the checkout action.

Setup-python is another useful action that install the specific version of Python for us in the VM.

## Environment Variables
### Custom Environment Variables
Use the `env` key to create custom environment variables in the workflow.

You can define the environment variables that are scoped for:
- The entire workflow.
- Job level.
- Step level.

### Default Environment Variables
- GITHUB_WORKFLOW.

- GITHUB_ACTION.

- GITHUB_REPOSITORY.

- GITHUB_ACTOR.

Etc
```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Default ENV Variables
        run: |
          echo "HOME: ${HOME}"
          echo "GITHUB_WORKFLOW: ${GITHUB_WORKFLOW}" # Name of the workflow
          echo "GITHUB_ACTION: ${GITHUB_ACTION}" # Name of the action
          echo "GITHUB_ACTIONS: ${GITHUB_ACTIONS}" # Always true when running in GitHub Actions
          echo "GITHUB_ACTOR: ${GITHUB_ACTOR}" # Name of the person who triggered the workflow
          echo "GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" # Owner/Repo
```
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables


# Expressions
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions

`${{}}`  You can use expressions to programmatically set environment variables in workflow files and access contexts. An expression can be any combination of literal values, references to a context, or functions.

For example, you can use it to refer to the secret variables you stored in the Github settings.

```yaml
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Dockerhub Login
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```


# Deploy

The Github Actions will be triggered when the code is pushed to the git repo.

The build job builds a docker image and push it to my Dockerhub registry.

The deployment is in-place deploy, which would cause a short down time of the application.


# Steps

When you are using the in place deployment method, please have an ec2 instance ready with docker installed and configured. Then store the username, the IP address and content of the pem file of the ec2 in repository secrets.
